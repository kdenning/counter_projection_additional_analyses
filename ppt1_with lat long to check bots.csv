She kisses her husband good-bye on his way to work, as a manager who feels that Caucasian men are losing their place in America. On Jen's way to work, she stops at a local restaurant and orders breakfast. While she can almost remember what it was like in college having to work these kinds of jobs, for some reason she doesn't think it's imperative to change the fact that these employees are making the same or less in pay than she was making all those years ago.

Jen gets to work, and is startled by a random homeless minority in the parking lot. She hurriedly gets inside of the building, thinking to herself that there ought to be a law for ""people like them."" She voted on a liar who promised he would take care of vets, but doesn't even attempt to formulate in her mind that the homeless person she just saw was a vet. 

Once at work, Jen attempts to ignore her ""liberal"" coworkers. She thinks that they're just sore losers about the fact that Trump won. She doesn't let herself think about the fact that there's lots of evidence that Russia colluded with members of Trump's team. For whatever reason, she's tuned out the fact that Trump himself publicly told Russia to dig into Hillary Clinton's emails. When she walks around her office at work, she notices that most employees there attempt to avoid her. For whatever reason though, she continues to label them as sore losers. When someone makes a statement regarding the FBI's investigation of Trump, she without a doubt wishes that they would ""drop it."" 

Jen doesn't understand why she's been working here for so long, but doesn't seem to be on track for any form of meaningful advancement. When an older male in management subtly sexually harasses her at work, she wishes something could be done about him, then forgets the matter. 

Jen leaves work for the day. On her way home, she's stopped several times, due to waiting for school buses full of children. She thinks to herself that she'll be happy to have kids eventually, but she's glad she doesn't at this time, due to headlines of worsening schools. She thinks to herself that when she has children, they won't be in any public schools. She'll have them in the best private schools in her city. Oh wait...she just remembered. There's been an issue at that school, due to them being forced to admit more minority students. She then begins considering the 2nd best private school in her city, they don't problems with any minorities there...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,2,3,1,3,2,5,1,1,4,2,1,2,5,1,4,1,5,5,1,5,1,2,5,6,6,6,2,3,2,4,6,3,3,4,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,5,5,6,5,2,4,6,5,1,7,2,5,1,42,1,,5,23,3,,1,,1,,1,,6,62,56,7994569,

She does not necessarily fix breakfast for a husband regularly and lets her kids, if any, behave selfishly, giving into their whims unless it upsets her own daily schedule. She goes to her job each day and often complains about President Trump, often talking about issues such as gender inequality, how it's wrong for poor children to have nothing while rich have much. She is very sociable and often dominates conversations, giving her opinion on political issues or local elections to her coworkers at lunch time. She eats healthily and exercises regularly. She does volunteer work for the poor or for promoting things like buying locally or organically, maybe even being a vegetarian, not eating meat for she dislikes the idea of harming animals. She comes home from work normally busy with volunteering and her children, if any, are second place in her life as is her husband. She picks up thekids from school, but mostly sees them as an interruption to her goals of changing the world and helping the poor. She enjoys spending time in social causes, often making telephone calls to her liberal friends on projects with volunteering or promoting social causes or political rallies. She is very, very busy. She reads ""The Onion"" and ""The Huffington Post"" daily along with watching the comedy shows that often make fun of the President. She attends protests, maybe organizing some, against Republicans or conservatives that seem to defeat her purpose of changing society to liberal views without God. She does not pray to God, thinking that only she can control her future, her family, her children.

She probably goes through her day doing little things to ""help"" others, but really she is giving money or time to people who will ma goal.

I think her goals will include things like saving the environment, standing up for woman's right to kill inborn children, protesting and signing petitions for everything from gun control to accepting refugees.

She's been unemployed for a while, and she believes Trump's rhetoric about bringing jobs back. She feels that, although Trump is a multi-millionaire and a trust fund baby, that somehow Trump understands what it's like to be a working class person struggling to make ends meet. She believes that Trump has a keen understanding of the economy because he's been depicted firing people on reality TV, despite his many bankruptcies and lawsuits. She's willing to ignore the allegations of sexual assault because there has been no criminal convictions, yet she's willing to believe the vitriol against Clinton, despite her lack of criminal history and her decades of public service. She believes that because Trump brown-noses the religious right, that he's a godly man--despite his multiple divorces, abhorrent treatment of women, and lack of any sort of personal ethics or accountability whatsoever. She's embarrassed by his nonstop scandals since entering into office, but continues to defend him whenever the subject is raised with her friends and coworkers simply because she can't admit that she was wrong. She's pleased that she didn't vote for ""that criminal, Clinton,"" but she ignores the allegations of money laundering via Trump Foundation. Jen is a sad, delusional woman who will continue to deny that she made a mistake, right through Trump's impeachment for treason for colluding with the Russians. Oh, and Jen also ignores the Steele dossier, thinking that something that disgusting simply can't be true about her idol. She's never bothered to do anything more than surface research on Trump before voting for him, and she's certainly never heard the allegations that Trump once tried to push a fellow boarding school student out of a second story window--and likely would have killed that student if others hadn't intervened and held him back.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,2,2,5,1,5,1,1,5,5,2,1,5,4,1,1,1,3,5,1,1,5,,1,6,6,6,1,1,1,6,6,1,1,1,6,6,6,1,1,6,6,1,1,1,1,6,6,6,3,1,6,1,6,1,7,1,1,1,32,2,,5,1,6,,1,,1,,1,,6,60,55,91203261,

She smiles at him and says a silent prayer for his soul as she goes to meet her friend Deb for lunch. At lunch, Jen and Deb make idle conversation and laugh about their day. Their waiter has dark skin. Jen hopes he isn't one of those muslims. She tries to hide her unfomfortable feelings because she's afraid of what Deb would say. Jen knows Deb is a liberal because she sometimes posts about how unfair she thinks the world is for the ""disadvantaged"" students she teaches. Whenever Jen thinks about this, she shakes her head because life is hard for her family too, but they get by. Jen and Deb never seem to talk about their views though, and she likes it that way. After work, Jen races home. She's excited to see her family and it's been a long day. This used to be the night they would all go out to dinner together, but things have been different since her husband's hours got cut at the plant. He says it's because the bosses had to bring on more minorities to meet some diversity quota. Jen sighs and thinks about how different things will be when Trump builds that damn wall.
